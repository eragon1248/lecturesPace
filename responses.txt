Page 1: Welcome, students, to Lecture 7 of our Computer Vision course, CS376. Today's focus will be on an essential technique in the field of computer vision called the Hough Transform. This technique is widely used for the analysis of images, particularly for detecting simple shapes such as lines, circles, and other parametric curves within an image. The Hough Transform is particularly useful in noisy environments and can robustly extract features that are difficult to discern by other methods.

On this slide, you can see a representation of different computer vision tasks that can potentially leverage the Hough Transform. These tasks could range from object recognition to scene understanding or even 3D reconstruction, which are all common problems in computer vision.

In the upper left corner, there appears to be a 3D-point cloud visualization, which could represent a scanned scene with multiple figures. This demonstrates a scenario where the Hough Transform might be applied to identify the orientation and position of objects within the scene.

The central part of the slide features an abstract representation of a pipeline or process. Although I cannot provide specifics without the actual context, it commonly shows a series of operations on an image, like capturing an RGB-D scan, applying some transformation or processing module, and finally, utilizing a pose estimation module. These elements hint at the complex processes involved in analyzing and understanding the images using computer vision techniques.

In the lower left, you see an aerial image with overlaid geometric shapes. This could illustrate an application of the Hough Transform

Page 2: Alright, class, today we're going to review several fundamental concepts related to image processing and analysis, with a focus on local analysis techniques.

First, let's talk about **Image Filters**. Image filtering is a technique used for enhancing or modifying images by removing noise, improving clarity, or detecting edges. Filters can be applied in both the spatial and frequency domains, and they can be linear (like Gaussian or box filters) or non-linear (like median filters). Filtering can help prepare an image for further processing or enhance features that are crucial for analysis.

Next is **Edge Detection**, which is a critical step in image analysis. Edges are significant local changes in intensity in an image, often corresponding to object boundaries, texture changes, or other important features. Edge detection algorithms, such as the Sobel, Canny, or Prewitt operators, are designed to highlight these changes and provide us with the essential structure of objects within the image.

Moving on, we have **Binary Image Analysis**. In this analysis, images are simplified into two values—typically black and white—representing the object(s) of interest and the background. Once an image is binarized, we can perform various operations to quantify the properties of the objects, such as counting objects, measuring their area, or analyzing their shape.

Fourthly, we'll cover **Texture**. Texture refers to the visual patterns in an image that have properties of homogeneity and do not result from the presence of a single color

Page 3: Welcome, class. Today, we're discussing the concept of model fitting in the context of computer vision and image analysis.

The slide we're looking at is titled "Now: Fitting," and it's centering on the idea of how we can associate a model with observed features from an image. Model fitting is an essential part of computer vision, where we attempt to map a predefined model to the data that we observe within an image.

The slide shows several examples of this process:

1. In the top left image, we see a grayscale photo of what appears to be an ATM. Next to it, there's a black and white outline illustrating the extraction of structural features from the photo.

2. In the central top image, the model fitting involves overlaying pink lines, which could represent edges or specific shapes, that are algorithmically detected within the scene.

3. The top right image illustrates a monochrome photo of an interior space with what looks like a rectangular selection around a part of the structure, possibly identifying an object of interest or a region for further analysis.

4. The bottom left image shows coins on a textured fabric surface. The coins are circle-shaped, and fitting a circular model to these coins would allow a computer vision system to identify and possibly classify them.

5. The bottom right sequence displays two images of the same car. On the left, the car is highlighted with a yellow contour line that closely fits its shape, showing how a more complex, arbitrary shape can be fitted

Page 4: Certainly! Today, we're going to discuss the various applications of some core concepts in computer vision and image processing. As you can see from the slide, there are three major bullet points, each representing a different domain of application.

Let's start with "Vanishing point detection."

1. Vanishing Point Detection:
This refers to the process of identifying the point in an image where parallel lines appear to converge. This is especially important in fields like architectural photography, computer graphics, and robotics. In autonomous vehicles, for instance, vanishing point detection helps in understanding the road structure and can assist in lane detection.

Next, we have "Segmentation/Detection."

2. Segmentation/Detection:
Segmentation involves dividing an image into multiple segments to simplify the representation of the image into something more meaningful and easier to analyze. Image segmentation is widely used in medical imaging, face recognition, and traffic control systems. Object detection is a related concept where the goal is to detect instances of objects within an image. This technology is crucial in various fields such as surveillance and autonomous driving.

Finally, we talk about "3D Vision."

3. 3D Vision:
This encompasses a variety of methods that allow machines to perceive depth and structure of the environment. There are two aspects mentioned here:

   a. Calibration - Calibration in 3D vision is necessary to relate the dimensions of an image to real-world coordinates. It allows the camera to capture the world with as much spatial fidelity as possible.

   b.

Page 5: Class, today we're going to discuss a concept that is integral to data analysis and modeling, which is 'Fitting'. Specifically, we'll talk about the main idea behind fitting a model to data, as well as some related challenges.

The primary goal when we talk about fitting is to select a parametric model that can accurately represent a set of features from our data. What does that mean? Well, a parametric model is a mathematical framework that we use to summarize data using a few parameters. When we choose such a model, we're trying to find a mathematical formula or function that captures the essence or trend of our data points.

Imagine you have a scatterplot of data points, and you want to find the best line that represents the trend of those points. In fitting a model, you're essentially searching for the parameters (like the slope and intercept for a line) that define that best fit.

However, when we attempt to do that, we encounter what are known as correlated problems, such as:

1. Determining what kind of models to consider. This includes deciding among various types of functions—linear, quadratic, exponential, or perhaps a custom model suited for your specific dataset.

2. Understanding the association between models and features. Here, we want to know how the parameters of our model relate to the features (or variables) in our data. For instance, we might ask how changing one parameter affects the fit of our model to the data.

3. Optimizing the

Page 6: Alright, class, today we're going to discuss the concept of line fitting in the context of image processing and computer vision. This slide presents a case study to illustrate why the technique of fitting lines to images can be important.

First, let's address the question: Why fit lines? The answer to that is relatively straightforward. Line features are ubiquitous in our environment and therefore are commonly found in natural images. When we talk about 'line features,' we're referring to visual elements in images that are characteristically straight and elongate. These could include the edges of buildings, road markings, the horizon, and other architectural features.

Looking at the images provided on the slide, we can see examples of these kinds of line features. In the photo of the building, the edges of the structure, the lines around the windows, doorways, and the outline of the tower are all examples of line features. These can serve as important cues for understanding the image's structure and geometry.

In the second image, which appears to be a street view, line fitting has been applied to mark the boundaries of the road. You can see the green lines annotating the edges of the road as well as the red lines highlighting other significant linear features in the scene, like the road markings. These fitted lines help us to understand the perspective and layout of the road, which can be essential for tasks like autonomous vehicle navigation, where the vehicle needs to know where the lanes are in order to drive safely.

Line fitting algorithms are

Page 7: Welcome everyone. Today, we're going to discuss the "Difficulty of Line Fitting" in the context of image processing and computer vision. As you can see from the slide, line fitting is a common task when we want to interpret or analyze the geometric structure of features within an image. However, there are several challenges that we face when performing this task.

Firstly, we have what's called "incomplete edge detections." When we apply an edge detection algorithm to an image, like the building shown here, we expect to get clear, continuous outlines of the structures within the image. However, this process isn't perfect. Sometimes, due to variations in lighting, texture, or other factors, the detected edges can be fragmented or incomplete. This makes it difficult to accurately fit lines to these edges since we're missing pieces of the puzzle.

Next, we need to decide "how many lines" are actually in the image. This might seem straightforward at first, but due to noise and the complexity of real-world images, it's challenging to determine the exact number of distinct straight lines that represent the structure of the object. Over-segmentation can lead to too many lines that don't correspond to meaningful features, whereas under-segmentation might miss important details.

Another point is that "not all edges are lines." When we look at the outlines of a building, not all the edges we detect should be represented as straight lines. Some edges may be curves or part of more complex geometric shapes.



Page 8: Alright, class, today we're going to discuss a concept related to model selection and feature space called "Voting". Let's begin by understanding the bullet points on the slide one by one.

The first bullet point says, "Impossible to test all combinations of features to extract the models". This is highlighting a common problem in machine learning and data science where we have a large number of possible feature combinations that we could use to train our models. Since it's infeasible to try out every possible combination due to computational constraints, we must find a more efficient way to select the most relevant features for our model. This is where the notion of "voting" comes into play.

Moving on to the second bullet point, we're introduced to the actual strategy of letting features "vote" for the models. This is a metaphorical way of saying that we select features based on how well they contribute to the performance of the models. The process detailed here consists of cycling through features and allowing them to cast votes for model parameters. We do not mean literal voting here; this is an analogy for a statistical or algorithmic process where features influence the selection or weighting of parameters in a model.

When it says, "Usually each model should be low-dimensional," it refers to the concept that simpler models with fewer features are often more generalizable and easier to interpret. This principle relates to the idea of Occam's razor in model selection, which suggests that among competing hypotheses that predict equally well, the one

Page 9: Alright, class, today we'll be discussing how to fit lines in images using a technique called the Hough transform.

Imagine you have a digital image and within this image, there are various points that you suspect form part of straight lines. Our objectives might include:

1. Understanding the mathematical representation of the line that these points belong to.
2. Determining the number of distinct lines present in the image.
3. Associating each point with the respective line it lies on.

To accomplish this, we use the Hough Transform, which is a feature extraction technique used in image analysis, computer vision, and digital image processing. Let's break this down:

- The Hough Transform works as a voting procedure. Every point in the image gets to "vote" for all the possible lines that pass through it.
- In a more technical sense, each point in the parameter space accumulates votes in an accumulator space, where a cell in this space represents a potential line in the original image space.
- When lots of points belong to the same line, they will collectively cast many votes for that line's presence, making it detectable as a peak in the accumulator space.

To visualize the concept, let's look at the images on the right:

- The first picture shows a real-world scenario (like a part of a paper tray) where we may want to detect straight lines.
- The second image depicts an edge-detected version of the scene using a technique such as the Canny edge detector

Page 10: Alright, class, today we're looking at a slide that presents some "Basic Facts." These are likely related to a statistical modeling, machine learning, or decision-making context. Let's break down what each bullet point might relate to in this context.

1. Not all the votes are correct, but the correct ones form 'clusters'.
- In this point, we're talking about 'votes.' Votes could be literal, as in a voting system, or metaphorical, referring to individual predictions by a set of models or algorithms in an ensemble learning scenario. Ensemble learning involves combining multiple models to improve the accuracy of predictions by 'voting' on the output. This point is acknowledging that while not every prediction (vote) made by individual models will be accurate, the accurate predictions tend to be clustered together. That means that when looking at the space of predictions, the correct ones are more frequently in agreement with each other than with incorrect ones.

2. Depend on the representations of the models.
- This means that the outcome, which could be the accuracy of the final model or its predictions, is influenced by how the data is represented within each of the individual models. The 'representation' can include feature selection, how the data is preprocessed, or the specific structure of the model. Different representations can capture different patterns within the data and thus lead to different predictive performances.

3. Depend on how we fit the models.
- The final fact emphasizes the importance of the fit of the models. 'F
